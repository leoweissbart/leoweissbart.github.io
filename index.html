<span style="color:#999;">In recent years machine learning has become increasingly mainstream across industries. Additionally, Graphical Processing Unit (GPU)
	 accelerators are widely deployed in various neural network (NN) applications, including image recognition for autonomous vehicles and natural language 
	 processing, among others. Since training a powerful network requires expensive data collection and computing power, its design and parameters are often 
	 considered a secret intellectual property of their manufacturers. However, hardware accelerators can leak crucial information about the secret neural 
	 network designs through side-channels, like Electro-Magnetic (EM) emanations, power consumption, or timing. We propose and evaluate non-invasive and 
	 passive reverse engineering methods to recover NN designs deployed on GPUs through EM side-channel analysis. We employ a well-known technique of simple
	 EM analysis and timing analysis of NN layers execution. We consider commonly used NN architectures, namely Multilayer Perceptron and Convolutional Neural 
	 Networks. We show how to recover the number of layers and neurons as well as the types of activation functions. Our experimental results are obtained on 
	 a setup that is as close as possible to a real-world device in order to properly assess the applicability and extendability of our methods. We analyze 
	 the NN execution of a PyTorch python framework implementation running on Nvidia Jetson Nano, a module computer embedding a Tegra X1 SoC that combines 
	 an ARM Cortex-A57 CPU and a 128-core GPU within a Maxwell architecture. Our results show the importance of side-channel protections for NN accelerators
	 in real-world applications.

<p><i>Network and Distributed System Security Symposium - NDSS 2021</i><br>
<span style="color:#999;">    We introduce screen gleaning, a TEMPEST attack in which the screen of a mobile device is read without a visual line of sight, 
	revealing sensitive information displayed on the phone screen. The screen gleaning attack uses an antenna and a software-defined radio (SDR) to pick up 
	the electromagnetic signal that the device sends to the screen to display, e.g., a message with a security code. This special equipment makes it possible 
	to recreate the signal as a gray-scale image, which we refer to as an emage. Here, we show that it can be used to read a security code. The screen gleaning 
	attack is challenging because it is often impossible for a human viewer to interpret the emage directly. We show that this challenge can be addressed with 
	machine learning, specifically, a deep learning classifier. Screen gleaning will become increasingly serious as SDRs and deep learning continue to rapidly 
	advance. In this paper, we demonstrate the security code attack and we propose a testbed that provides a standard setup in which screen gleaning could be 
	tested with different attacker models. Finally, we analyze the dimensions of screen gleaning attacker models and discuss possible countermeasures with the 
	potential to address them.

<span style="color:#999;">Profiling attacks, especially those based on machine learning, proved to be very successful techniques in recent years when considering
	the side-channel analysis of symmetric-key crypto implementations. At the same time, the results for implementations of asymmetric-key cryptosystems are very
	sparse. This paper considers several machine learning techniques to mount side-channel attacks on two implementations of scalar multiplication on the elliptic
	curve Curve25519. The first implementation follows the baseline implementation with complete formulae as used for EdDSA in WolfSSl, where we exploit power 
	consumption as a side-channel. The second implementation features several countermeasures, and in this case, we analyze electromagnetic emanations to find 
	side-channel leakage. Most techniques considered in this work result in potent attacks, and especially the method of choice appears to be convolutional 
	neural networks (CNNs), which can break the first implementation with only a single measurement in the attack phase. The same convolutional neural network 
	demonstrated excellent performance for attacking AES cipher implementations. Our results show that some common grounds can be established when using deep 
	learning for profiling attacks on very different cryptographic algorithms and their corresponding implementations.

<p><i>Artificial Intelligence in Hardware Security - AIHWS 2020</i><br>
<span style="color:#999;">In profiling side-channel analysis, machine learning-based attacks nowadays offer the most powerful performance. 
	This holds especially for techniques stemming from the neural network family: multilayer perceptron and convolutional neural networks. 
	Convolutional neural networks are often favored as state-of-the-art results suggest better performance, especially in scenarios where targets 
	are protected with countermeasures. Multilayer perceptron receives much less attention and researchers seem less interested in this technique, 
	narrowing the results in the literature to comparisons with convolutional neural networks. Yet, a multilayer perceptron has a much simpler structure, 
	which enables easier hyperparameter tuning, and hopefully, could contribute to the explainability of this neural network inner working.
	In this paper, we investigate the behavior of a multilayer perceptron in detail in the context of the side-channel analysis of AES. By exploring 
	the sensitivity of multilayer perceptron hyperparameters over the performance of the attack, we aim at providing a better understanding of successful 
	hyperparameters tuning, and ultimately, the performance of this algorithm. Our results show that MLP (with a proper hyperparameter tuning) can easily 
	break implementations having a random delay or masking countermeasures.

<p><i>Seventh International Symposium on Computing and Networking - CANDAR 2019</i><br>
<span style="color:#999;"> Among the increasing evolution of IoT devices, practical applications need reliable secure protocols to communicate with each other. 
	A major issue for modern cryptosystems is an implementation of secure and trustworthy mechanisms to rely on. A side-channel attack against these cryptosystems 
	may overturn the guarantee of security against conventional cyber-attacks. Elliptic curve cryptography is public-key cryptography based on elliptic curves, and 
	one of the well-known curves is Curve25519 which is used for TLS protocols as a recommended curve. This curve is mainly implemented on limited resource devices 
	such as microcontrollers. However, this curve poses a weakness for low-order points during a Diffie-Hellman key exchange is employed. This research demonstrates 
	possible exploitation of a threat of order 8 rational points of Curve25519 and shows results of the side-channel attacks using order 8 rational points on an 
	embedded system. The results indicate the order 8 rational points might be applied to key extraction as attacker sides. </span><br /></p></dd></dl>

<span style="color:#999;"> Profiling attacks, especially those based on machine learning proved as very successful techniques in recent years when

	are very sparse. In this paper, we consider several machine learning techniques in order to mount a power analysis attack on EdDSA using the curve 
	Curve25519 as implemented in WolfSSL. The results show all considered techniques to be viable and powerful options. The results with convolutional 
	neural networks (CNNs) are especially impressive as we are able to break the implementation with only a single measurement in the attack phase while 
	requiring less than 500 measurements in the training phase. Interestingly, that same convolutional neural network was recently shown to perform 
	extremely well for attacking the AES cipher. Our results show that some common grounds can be established when using deep learning for profiling 
	attacks on distinct cryptographic algorithms and their corresponding implementations.  </span><br /></p></dd></dl>

<span style="color:#999;"> With the matter of secure communication between devices, and especially for IoT devices, more and more applications need 
	trustful protocols to communicate using public key cryptography. Elliptic curve cryptography is nowadays a very secure and efficient public key 
	cryptography method. One of the most recent and secure curve is Curve25519 and one of its failure is attack on low-order elements during a 
	Diffie-Hellman key exchange. This document demonstrates that an attack using an order 4 point is possible on an embedded system with a simple 
	power analysis, pointing out every IoT using Curve255119 as a cryptographic method, a potential target to side-channel attacks. </span><br /></p></dd></dl>
