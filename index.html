	<span class="item-description">In this paper, we conduct an in-depth power side-channel analysis of Xoodyak, a lightweight cryptographic algorithm implemented on an FPGA platform. Our analysis focuses on the initialization phase of Xoodyak in its authenticated encryption with associated data mode. We introduce a new leakage model and perform an initial leakage assessment to identify potential vulnerabilities. Subsequently, we carry out both non-profiled and profiled attacks to determine how exploitable the observed leakages are.
	We use correlation power analysis for the non-profiled analysis, applying it across all key bits. This approach yields a success rate of 91.4% with 50,000 traces. In our profiled attack phase, we deploy both a template attack and a deep learning-based attack. The template attack achieves a success rate of 99.2%, recovering almost all key bits using 20,000 traces. Meanwhile, the deep learning approach reaches zero guessing entropy within 550 traces and successfully adapts to the leakage model within 50 epochs.
	To enhance the resilience of Xoodyak against side-channel attacks, we develop a configurable implementation based on domain-oriented masking (DOM) scheme. Our d-th order masked implementation employs d+1 shares, requiring d(d+1)/2 units of fresh randomness per round. We then assess the resource requirements of these masked implementations on both ASIC and FPGA platforms, up to order 5. As a practical demonstration, we program the main Spartan-6 FPGA on the Sakura-G evaluation board with both the unprotected and the first-order domain-oriented protected implementations. A test vector leakage assessment based on Welch's t-test is then conducted to confirm the improved resistance of this Xoodyak implementation protected against first-order power analysis attacks.</span><br /></p></dd></dl>

	<span class="item-description"> Over the last decade, applications of neural networks have spread to every aspect of our lives. A large number of companies base their businesses on building products that use neural networks for tasks such as face recognition, machine translation, and self-driving cars. Much of the intellectual property underpinning these products is encoded in the exact parameters of the neural networks. Consequently, protecting these is of utmost priority to businesses. At the same time, many of these products need to operate under a strong threat model, in which the adversary has unfettered physical control of the product. In this work, we present BarraCUDA, a novel attack on general-purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) that can extract parameters of neural networks running on the popular Nvidia Jetson devices. BarraCUDA relies on the observation that the convolution operation, used during inference, must be computed as a sequence of partial sums, each leaking one or a few parameters. Using correlation electromagnetic analysis with these partial sums, BarraCUDA can recover parameters of real-world convolutional neural networks. </span><br /></p></dd></dl>

  <span class="item-description"> Side-Channel Analysis (SCA) is critical in evaluating the security of cryptographic implementations. In recent years, the use of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in SCA has risen in popularity. However, DNNs consists of many hyperparameters and not every configuration of hyperparameters result in successful attack. Therefore, the search for DNN’s hyperparameters poses a significant challenge, especially when resources are limited. In this work, we explore the efficacy of a multifidelity optimization technique known as Bayesian Optimization HyperBand (BOHB) in SCA. This introduces the notion of budget within SCA to encapsulate the idea of resources when tuning the hyperparmeters of the DNNs. Next, we proposed a new objective function called ge_{+ntge}, which could be incorporated into any Bayesian Optimization used in SCA. We show the capabilities of both BOHB and ge_{+ntge} on four different public datasets. Specifically, BOHB could obtain the least number of traces in the dataset called CTF2018 when trained in the Hamming weight and identity leakage models. Notably, this marks the first reported successful recovery of the key for the identity leakage model in CTF2018.</span><br /></p></dd></dl>

	<span class="item-description"> Deep learning is becoming an increasingly proficient tool for side-channel analysis. While deep learning has been evolving around the tasks of image and speech recognition for decades, it is still lacking maturity for side-channel analysis. One of the challenges to train a good model is the fine-tuning of its hyperparameters. Many methods have been developed for Hyperparameter Optimization, but a few have been applied for deep learning side-channel analysis. We study the use of sampling algorithm and early-stopping mechanism in the hyperparameter optimization search for deep learning side-channel analysis models. We also offer a scalable deep learning framework to extend results obtained for other problems and datasets. Our results show that hyperparameter optimization methods can save time and resources while leading to models that can lead to the best possible output and at the same time are providing more confidence whether to look for a better model.</span><br /></p></dd></dl>

<p><i>Artificial Intelligence in Hardware Security - AIHWS 2024</i><br>
	<span class="item-description"> In recent years, deep learning-based side-channel analysis (DLSCA) has become an active research topic within the side-channel analysis community. The well-known challenge of hyperparameter tuning in DLSCA encouraged the community to use methods that reduce the effort required to identify an optimal model. One of the successful methods is ensemble learning. While ensemble methods have demonstrated their effectiveness in DLSCA, particularly with AES-based datasets, their efficacy in analyzing symmetric-key cryptographic primitives with different operational mechanics remains unexplored.
	Ascon was recently announced as the winner of the NIST lightweight cryptography competition. This will lead to broader use of Ascon and a crucial requirement for thorough side-channel analysis of its implementations. With these two considerations in view, we utilize an ensemble of deep neural networks to attack two implementations of Ascon. Using an ensemble of five multilayer perceptrons or convolutional neural networks, we could find the secret key for the Ascon-protected implementation with less than 3 000 traces. To the best of our knowledge, this is the best currently known result. We can also identify the correct key with less than 100 traces for the unprotected implementation of Ascon, which is on par with the state-of-the-art results. </span><br /></p></dd></dl>

<span class="item-description"> Ascon is a recently standardized suite of symmetric cryptography for authenticated encryption and hashing algorithms designed to be lightweight.
	The Ascon scheme has been studied since it was introduced in 2015 for the CAESAR competition, and many efforts have been made to transform this hardware-oriented scheme to work with any embedded device architecture.
	Ascon is designed with side-channel resistance in mind and can also be protected with countermeasures against side-channel analysis.
	Up to now, the effort of side-channel analysis is mainly put on hardware implementations, with only a few studies being published on the real-world side-channel security of software implementations.
	In this paper, we give a comprehensive view of the side-channel security of Ascon implemented on a 32-bit microcontroller for both the reference and a protected implementation.
	We show different potential leakage functions that can lead to real-world leakages and demonstrate the most potent attacks that can be obtained with the corresponding leakage functions.
	We present our results using correlation power analysis (CPA) and deep learning-based side-channel analysis and provide a practical estimation of the efforts needed for an attacker to recover the complete key used for authenticated encryption.
	Our results show that the reference implementation is not side-channel secure since an attacker can recover the full key with 8,000 traces using CPA and around 1,000 traces with deep learning analysis. 
	While second-order CPA cannot recover any part of the secret, deep learning side-channel analysis can recover partial keys with 800 traces on the protected implementation.
	Unfortunately, the model used for multi-task key recovery lacks the generalization to correctly recover all partial keys for the full key attack.</span><br /></p></dd></dl>

<span class="item-description">The efficiency of the profiling side-channel analysis can be significantly improved with machine learning techniques. Although 
	powerful, a fundamental machine learning limitation of being data-hungry received little attention in the side-channel community. In practice, the maximum
	number of leakage traces that evaluators/attackers can obtain is constrained by the scheme requirements or the limited accessibility of the target. 
	Even worse, various countermeasures in modern devices increase the conditions on the profiling size to break the target. This work demonstrates a 
	practical approach to dealing with the lack of profiling traces. Instead of learning from a one-hot encoded label, transferring the labels to their 
	distribution can significantly speed up the convergence of guessing entropy. By studying the relationship between all possible key candidates, we 
	propose a new metric, denoted Label Correlation (LC), to evaluate the generalization ability of the profiling model. We validate LC with two common 
	use cases: early stopping and network architecture search, and the results indicate its superior performance.

<span class="item-description">In recent years machine learning has become increasingly mainstream across industries. Additionally, Graphical Processing Unit (GPU)
	accelerators are widely deployed in various neural network (NN) applications, including image recognition for autonomous vehicles and natural language 
	processing, among others. Since training a powerful network requires expensive data collection and computing power, its design and parameters are often 
	considered a secret intellectual property of their manufacturers. However, hardware accelerators can leak crucial information about the secret neural 
	network designs through side-channels, like Electro-Magnetic (EM) emanations, power consumption, or timing. We propose and evaluate non-invasive and 
	passive reverse engineering methods to recover NN designs deployed on GPUs through EM side-channel analysis. We employ a well-known technique of simple
	EM analysis and timing analysis of NN layers execution. We consider commonly used NN architectures, namely Multilayer Perceptron and Convolutional Neural 
	Networks. We show how to recover the number of layers and neurons as well as the types of activation functions. Our experimental results are obtained on 
	a setup that is as close as possible to a real-world device in order to properly assess the applicability and extendability of our methods. We analyze 
	the NN execution of a PyTorch python framework implementation running on Nvidia Jetson Nano, a module computer embedding a Tegra X1 SoC that combines

<span class="item-description">    We introduce screen gleaning, a TEMPEST attack in which the screen of a mobile device is read without a visual line of sight, 
	revealing sensitive information displayed on the phone screen. The screen gleaning attack uses an antenna and a software-defined radio (SDR) to pick up 
	the electromagnetic signal that the device sends to the screen to display, e.g., a message with a security code. This special equipment makes it possible 
	to recreate the signal as a gray-scale image, which we refer to as an emage. Here, we show that it can be used to read a security code. The screen gleaning 
	attack is challenging because it is often impossible for a human viewer to interpret the emage directly. We show that this challenge can be addressed with 
	machine learning, specifically, a deep learning classifier. Screen gleaning will become increasingly serious as SDRs and deep learning continue to rapidly 
	advance. In this paper, we demonstrate the security code attack and we propose a testbed that provides a standard setup in which screen gleaning could be 
	tested with different attacker models. Finally, we analyze the dimensions of screen gleaning attacker models and discuss possible countermeasures with the 
	potential to address them.

<span class="item-description">Profiling attacks, especially those based on machine learning, proved to be very successful techniques in recent years when considering
	the side-channel analysis of symmetric-key crypto implementations. At the same time, the results for implementations of asymmetric-key cryptosystems are very
	sparse. This paper considers several machine learning techniques to mount side-channel attacks on two implementations of scalar multiplication on the elliptic
	curve Curve25519. The first implementation follows the baseline implementation with complete formulae as used for EdDSA in WolfSSl, where we exploit power 
	consumption as a side-channel. The second implementation features several countermeasures, and in this case, we analyze electromagnetic emanations to find 
	side-channel leakage. Most techniques considered in this work result in potent attacks, and especially the method of choice appears to be convolutional 
	neural networks (CNNs), which can break the first implementation with only a single measurement in the attack phase. The same convolutional neural network 
	demonstrated excellent performance for attacking AES cipher implementations. Our results show that some common grounds can be established when using deep

<span class="item-description">In profiling side-channel analysis, machine learning-based attacks nowadays offer the most powerful performance. 
	This holds especially for techniques stemming from the neural network family: multilayer perceptron and convolutional neural networks. 
	Convolutional neural networks are often favored as state-of-the-art results suggest better performance, especially in scenarios where targets 
	are protected with countermeasures. Multilayer perceptron receives much less attention and researchers seem less interested in this technique, 
	narrowing the results in the literature to comparisons with convolutional neural networks. Yet, a multilayer perceptron has a much simpler structure, 
	which enables easier hyperparameter tuning, and hopefully, could contribute to the explainability of this neural network inner working.
	In this paper, we investigate the behavior of a multilayer perceptron in detail in the context of the side-channel analysis of AES. By exploring 
	the sensitivity of multilayer perceptron hyperparameters over the performance of the attack, we aim at providing a better understanding of successful 
	hyperparameters tuning, and ultimately, the performance of this algorithm. Our results show that MLP (with a proper hyperparameter tuning) can easily 
	break implementations having a random delay or masking countermeasures.

	A major issue for modern cryptosystems is an implementation of secure and trustworthy mechanisms to rely on. A side-channel attack against these cryptosystems

	Diffie-Hellman key exchange. This document demonstrates that an attack using an order 4 point is possible on an embedded system with a simple 
	power analysis, pointing out every IoT using Curve255119 as a cryptographic method, a potential target to side-channel attacks. </span><br /></p></dd></dl>
