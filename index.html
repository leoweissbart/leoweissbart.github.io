<span style="color:#999;">In profiling side-channel analysis, machine learning-based attacks nowadays offer the most powerful performance. 
	This holds especially for techniques stemming from the neural network family: multilayer perceptron and convolutional neural networks. 
	Convolutional neural networks are often favored as state-of-the-art results suggest better performance, especially in scenarios where targets 
	are protected with countermeasures. Multilayer perceptron receives much less attention and researchers seem less interested in this technique, 
	narrowing the results in the literature to comparisons with convolutional neural networks. Yet, a multilayer perceptron has a much simpler structure, 
	which enables easier hyperparameter tuning, and hopefully, could contribute to the explainability of this neural network inner working.
	In this paper, we investigate the behavior of a multilayer perceptron in detail in the context of the side-channel analysis of AES. By exploring 
	the sensitivity of multilayer perceptron hyperparameters over the performance of the attack, we aim at providing a better understanding of successful 
	hyperparameters tuning, and ultimately, the performance of this algorithm. Our results show that MLP (with a proper hyperparameter tuning) can easily 
	break implementations having a random delay or masking countermeasures.

<span style="color:#999;"> Among the increasing evolution of IoT devices, practical applications need reliable secure protocols to communicate with each other. 
	A major issue for modern cryptosystems is an implementation of secure and trustworthy mechanisms to rely on. A side-channel attack against these cryptosystems 
	may overturn the guarantee of security against conventional cyber-attacks. Elliptic curve cryptography is public-key cryptography based on elliptic curves, and 
	one of the well-known curves is Curve25519 which is used for TLS protocols as a recommended curve. This curve is mainly implemented on limited resource devices 
	such as microcontrollers. However, this curve poses a weakness for low-order points during a Diffie-Hellman key exchange is employed. This research demonstrates 
	possible exploitation of a threat of order 8 rational points of Curve25519 and shows results of the side-channel attacks using order 8 rational points on an 
	embedded system. The results indicate the order 8 rational points might be applied to key extraction as attacker sides. </span><br /></p></dd></dl>

</dt><dd>
<p>Léo Weissbart, Stjepan Picek and Lejla Batina</p>
<span style="color:#999;"> Profiling attacks, especially those based on machine learning proved as very successful techniques in recent years when 
	considering side-channel analysis of block ciphers implementations. At the same time, the results for implementations public-key cryptosystems 
	are very sparse. In this paper, we consider several machine learning techniques in order to mount a power analysis attack on EdDSA using the curve 
	Curve25519 as implemented in WolfSSL. The results show all considered techniques to be viable and powerful options. The results with convolutional 
	neural networks (CNNs) are especially impressive as we are able to break the implementation with only a single measurement in the attack phase while 
	requiring less than 500 measurements in the training phase. Interestingly, that same convolutional neural network was recently shown to perform 
	extremely well for attacking the AES cipher. Our results show that some common grounds can be established when using deep learning for profiling 
	attacks on distinct cryptographic algorithms and their corresponding implementations.  </span><br /></p></dd></dl>

<p><i>The International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications - ISITA 2018</i><br>
<span style="color:#999;"> With the matter of secure communication between devices, and especially for IoT devices, more and more applications need 
	trustful protocols to communicate using public key cryptography. Elliptic curve cryptography is nowadays a very secure and efficient public key 
	cryptography method. One of the most recent and secure curve is Curve25519 and one of its failure is attack on low-order elements during a 
	Diffie-Hellman key exchange. This document demonstrates that an attack using an order 4 point is possible on an embedded system with a simple 
	power analysis, pointing out every IoT using Curve255119 as a cryptographic method, a potential target to side-channel attacks. </span><br /></p></dd></dl>
